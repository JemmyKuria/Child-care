# Child-care
Its a website that connects both parents and workers. It simply helps parents to find a child care giver easily and it helps care givers to find parents who need them easily. 
Steps taken:
Created a repository called child-care
Added folders eg tests, docs and src in the folder.
Created my own branch called "feature/add-about-page". Added a one page website.
Was added as a collaborator in Moses' project. I changed the about us page in my own branch and the header also. Created a conflict and resolved it.
RUNNING
After cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git, navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt. 
Open the HTML file with a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. 
To run the HTML file, right-click on it and select an option like "Open with" or "Open in browser," or simply double-click on the file. Your default web browser will display the webpage with the associated styles from the CSS file. 
Make any desired changes to the HTML and CSS files, save them, and refresh the browser (use `Ctrl + R` or `Cmd + R`) to see the updates. Iterate as needed until you achieve the desired result. If you encounter any issues, check the browser's console for error messages and refer to documentation or online resources for assistance.
