# Child-care
Its a website that connects both parents and workers. It simply helps parents to find a child care giver easily and it helps care givers to find parents who need them easily. 
Steps taken:
Created a repository called child-care
Added folders eg tests, docs and src in the folder.
Created my own branch called "feature/add-about-page". Added a one page website.
